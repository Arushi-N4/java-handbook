## Rules to keep in mind
+ If you have some enhancements to be made, new content to be added or fix bugs, first check currently active issues to check whether the issue is already existing or not before creating your own issue.

+ For adding new content specify properly in the issue about the content you are going to add. If the issue is assigned to you, create a directory and name it the same as the content you are going to add. Inside the directory create a README.md file and add your content over there. For reference, check out [**this**](./Hello_World/README.md).

+ Make sure to update the original [**README.md**](./README.md) and add the name of the concept in the contents.

+ If you have problems using git commands, check out the git cheatsheet pdf attached.
